# Let's Begin: Diving into Discovery

## Description/Abstract

Getting started on new work is hard. Like a writer struggling with a blank page, teams facing new problem domains, projects, and products often don't know where to begin. Or there are so many ideas to explore and directions that could be taken, the work feels untamable; and the team gets paralysed through lack of a clear starting point.

Relax. This is normal. Discovery is difficult, sometimes political, and always exciting.

Let me offer you some some tools, techniques, prompts, challenges, sympathy, and direction to help you get started with Discovery. Let me show you how to begin.

## Actionable Takeaways

After this session:

* You will have multiple tools to help run a discovery session from scratch.
* You will be able to help teams formulate, concretely, a direction to run in.
* You'll understand signs to look for that suggest you're trying too much at once.
* You will see how to build an ongoing process, guided by your starting direction, so that potentially difficult political situations can be headed off from the beginning.
* You'll have a collection of prompts and challenges to help people focus on the task at hand, and avoid going down rabbitholes.

## Session outline (reviewers only)

The session will start by introducing the problem. Discovery (the starting of projects or products) can be challenging for multiple reasons: 

* There are too many unknowns and people feel scared to step up
* There are too many possibilities and people don't know how to trim them
* People realise that this will set direction for the future and try to fix the agenda early.

We'll work through these scenarios, one at a time, talk about why they happen, and introduce tools and techniques to help make the best of each of them: a mix of quite intense 2hr to half-day sessions with multiple stakeholders, followed by practical hands-on exploration ahead of the next session.

I'll also introduce a selection of prompts, questions, and challenges that I've found useful to keep value in discovery sessions.

Finally, I hope to also talk about how  to bring clarity to expectations around Discovery, while removing some of the power dynamics that can prove problematic.

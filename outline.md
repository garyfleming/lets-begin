# Outline

(find this in  Adaptation )
To begin... To begin... How to start? I'm hungry. I should get coffee. Coffee would help me think. Maybe I should write something first, then reward myself with coffee. Coffee and a muffin. Okay, so I need to establish the themes. Maybe a banana-nut. That's a good muffin.

## Framing A - three scenarios as ways to verb

- There are too many unknowns and people feel scared to step up

With a huge number of possibilities, people get scared of 
* misunderstanding
* being misunderstood
* going in the wrong direction -- Looking stupid

-- This section should focus on **alignment**. Making sure we understand each other and what we're looking for. Suspect this might be the biggest part.

- There are too many possibilities and people don't know how to trim them

-- This section could focus on **selection**: making sure we know how and when to pick.

- People realise that this will set direction for the future and try to fix agenda early

-- This section could focus on **exploration**: going wide enough.

-- That tweet about things lasting forever being the wrong way to view the world


NOTE: don't love this framing.

-- This quote below, work in 

> We'll work through these scenarios, one at a time, talk about why they happen, and introduce tools and  techniques to help make the best of each of them: a mix of quite intense 2hr to half-day sessions with multiple stakeholders, followed by practical hands-on exploration ahead of the next session.


## Framing B three scenarios as is

For each

* There are too many unknowns and people feel scared to step up
* There are too many possibilities and people don't know how to trim them
* People realise that this will set direction for the future and try to fix the agenda early.

Create specific workshops or sessions to deal with them.

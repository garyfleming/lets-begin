^ Adaptation: To begin... To begin... How to start? I'm hungry. I should get coffee. Coffee would help me think. Maybe I should write something first, then reward myself with coffee. Coffee and a muffin. Okay, so I need to establish the themes. Maybe a banana-nut. That's a good muffin.

^ Getting started on new work is hard. Like a writer struggling with a blank page, teams facing new problem domains, projects, and products often don't know where to begin. Or there are so many ideas to explore and directions that could be taken, the work feels untamable; and the team gets paralysed through lack of a clear starting point.

^ Relax. This is normal. Discovery is difficult, sometimes political, and always exciting.

^ My name is gary fleming, I'm a recovering Agile Coach, but every time I get out they drag me back in. This talk is called... And it's about Discovering.

^ This talk is called Let's Begin: Diving into Discovery and it's about Discovery, and what I worked learning with a few teams. And it's important you understand something here, near the start.

# I Am Lying

^ Context: These teams were at different companies but I'm presenting them as if they were all at the same company, and I'm simplifying the stories a bit because reality is too mess for 45 minutes.
^ Is that really a lie, though? You trust me, RIGHT? 
^ TODO consider putting you trust me, right on a separate slide with big cheese salesman grin.

# Discovering Discovery

^ TODO what is discovery. Why would you do it. Is it formal?

Learning about...[^1]

* Your users and what they're trying to achieve
* constrains you'd face running the service (technology/legislative)
* Underlying intent you've been asked to address
* Opportunities to improve

^ I like this definition. I abbreviated it from GDS' service manual on agile delivery

Before you commit to building a service, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved.

^ Also starts with this. [read it]

 **Before** you **commit** to building a service, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved.

^ Focus on the before and the commit. Discovery is fundamentally an act of product assessment: . You're learning what you can early enough so you can help manage expectations. What is possible anywhere, what is possible for you in your context, what is impossible, what might fail, what might succeed, where value might lie, where TODO

^ TODO a whip.

^ I've seen teams committed to deliver services and products that were basically impossible based on the whims and fancies of people very far away from the product. While there's no avoiding that in some orgs, it helps to be armed with the best knowledge, ideas, and most importantly data that you can as EARLY AS possible. While some managers will never take their fingers out of their ears and continue to demand the impossible, many/most will listen to reason backed by data and ideas. Let me reiterate: data and ideas are the way out of a bunch of bad situations.

^ Importantly You are NOT trying to learn everything upfront. That's simply not possible. What you're trying to 

learn is enough to 

a) be talk/think/act coherently within the domain. -- Can't really do much on, say, a mapping project, if you don't understand a bit about tilesets, granularity, potentially geometric issues, possibly routing algorithms. Don't need absolute knowledge, but you do need enough to be coherent.

b) to find clear, coherent goals that'll help you ensure you're going in the right direction

c) to explore the space so you can find risks and pathways forward, 

d) to know what you're not doing.

^ TODO tie to ubiquitous language

^ Adaptation: To begin... To begin... How to start? I'm hungry. I should get coffee. Coffee would help me think. Maybe I should write something first, then reward myself with coffee. Coffee and a muffin. Okay, so I need to establish the themes. Maybe a banana-nut. That's a good muffin.

^ Getting started on new work is hard. Like a writer struggling with a blank page, teams facing new problem domains, projects, and products often don't know where to begin. Or there are so many ideas to explore and directions that could be taken, the work feels untamable; and the team gets paralysed through lack of a clear starting point.

^ Relax. This is normal. Discovery is difficult, sometimes political, and always exciting.

# Let's Begin: Diving Into Discovery

^ My name is gary fleming, I *WAS* an agile coach but I'm getting better now. That said, every time I get out they drag me back in.

^ This talk is called Let's Begin: Diving into Discovery and it's about Discovery, and what I worked learning with a few teams. And it's important you understand something here, near the start.

---

# I Am Lying

^ Context: These teams were at different companies but I'm presenting them as if they were all at the same company, and I'm simplifying the stories a bit because reality is too mess for 45 minutes.
^ Is that really a lie, though? You trust me, RIGHT? 
^ TODO consider putting you trust me, right on a separate slide with big cheese salesman grin.
^ TODO Is this still relevant? If we don't pick up the two companies thing later, take this out. If we do, make sure we do more setting up here. A slide or two of them coming to me with problems and the rest of the talk being a story to them rather than the audience

---

# Discovering Discovery

^ TODO what is discovery. Why would you do it. Is it formal?

^ Let's start by tryig to figure out what discovery is, why you would do it, and what shape it takes?
^ By that, I mean, is it a formal stringent process, or something else?
^ (it's something else)

^ TODO the something else it is a desired outcome that we can achieve through a bunch of agile tools tied together else?

Learning about...[^1]

* Your users and what they're trying to achieve
* constrains you'd face running the service (technology/legislative)
* Underlying intent you've been asked to address
* Opportunities to improve

[^1]: https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works

^ I like this definition. I abbreviated it from GDS' service manual on agile delivery. They're looking at discovery through the lens of Service Design, but I think this definition applies pretty broadly.

---

> Before you commit to building a service, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved.

^ Also starts with this. [read it]

---

 > **Before** you **commit** to building a service, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved.

^ Focus on the before and the commit. Discovery is fundamentally an act of product assessment and risk management: . You're learning what you can early enough so you can help manage expectations. What is possible anywhere, what is possible for you in your context, what is impossible (to some value of impossible), what might fail, what might succeed, where value might lie, where TODO
^ You're taking a) figuring out the kind of outcome you might want
^ and b) taking all of the infinite possibilities that lie before you and using various techniques to whittle down to a more manageable selection that are more disposited to achieving that goal
^ TODO Make sure the quotes are standout. Different colour than other text?

---

# Dispositional

^ As an aside, we use the word "dispositional" a lot when we leave some of the more common agile tools behind (because we've accepted the fact that there are no certainties).
^ It simply means something that leans towards the outcome we want.

---

^ An example: if you want to have a hit blockbuster action movie, and you cast someone who is pretty unknown it's not going to have much draw. That said, if you find the right person and have other good attributes (Tom Holland-spiderman), you can still be disposed to making money.
^ Similarly, if you cast someone like Dwayne Johnson, it's got a pretty good chance of bringing people in on that alone. But there's always failures like Southland Tales ($350K on a $17m budget)

^ TODO a grid of films with these actors


---

^ TODO a whip. Maybe

^ I've seen teams committed to deliver services and products that were basically impossible based on the whims and fancies of people very far away from the product. While there's no avoiding that in some orgs, it helps to be armed with the best knowledge, ideas, and most importantly data that you can as EARLY AS possible. While some managers will never take their fingers out of their ears and continue to demand the impossible, many/most will listen to reason backed by data and ideas. Let me reiterate: data and ideas are the way out of a bunch of bad situations.

---

^ Importantly You are NOT trying to learn everything upfront. That's simply not possible. What you're trying to 

learn is enough to 

a) be talk/think/act coherently within the domain. -- Can't really do much on, say, a mapping project, if you don't understand a bit about tilesets, granularity, potentially geometric issues, possibly routing algorithms. Don't need absolute knowledge, but you do need enough to be coherent.

^ TODO ubiquitous language

b) to find clear, coherent goals that'll help you ensure you're going in the right direction -- As you can speak/think about the domain in the terms of the domain, you can 

^ TODO OKRs, roadmaps. What kind of roadmap? Decision inflected

c) to explore the space so you can find risks and pathways forward, 

^ TODO bias to action

d) to know what you're not doing.

^ TODO 

And here's the thing, you're going to do these things all at the same time, in a swirling dynamic of learning; ping-ponging back and forward between language, and goals, and exploration, and editing, until... we'll get to that.

^ TODO image getting built up: pre-a), empty space, a) items in the space, b) an area we want to reach in the space, c) squiggly arrow paths, d) red areas. P

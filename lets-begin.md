^ Adaptation: To begin... To begin... How to start? I'm hungry. I should get coffee. Coffee would help me think. Maybe I should write something first, then reward myself with coffee. Coffee and a muffin. Okay, so I need to establish the themes. Maybe a banana-nut. That's a good muffin.

^ Getting started on new work is hard. Like a writer struggling with a blank page, teams facing new problem domains, projects, and products often don't know where to begin. Or there are so many ideas to explore and directions that could be taken, the work feels untamable; and the team gets paralysed through lack of a clear starting point.

^ Relax. This is normal. Discovery is difficult, sometimes political, and always exciting.

^ My name is gary fleming, I *WAS* an agile coach but I'm getting better now. That said, every time I get out they drag me back in.

^ This talk is called Let's Begin: Diving into Discovery and it's about Discovery, and what I worked learning with a few teams. And it's important you understand something here, near the start.

---

# I Am Lying

^ Context: These teams were at different companies but I'm presenting them as if they were all at the same company, and I'm simplifying the stories a bit because reality is too mess for 45 minutes.
^ Is that really a lie, though? You trust me, RIGHT? 
^ TODO consider putting you trust me, right on a separate slide with big cheese salesman grin.
^ TODO Is this still relevant? If we don't pick up the two companies thing later, take this out. If we do, make sure we do more setting up here. A slide or two of them coming to me with problems and the rest of the talk being a story to them rather than the audience

---

# Discovering Discovery

^ TODO what is discovery. Why would you do it. Is it formal?

^ Let's start by tryig to figure out what discovery is, why you would do it, and what shape it takes?
^ By that, I mean, is it a formal stringent process, or something else?
^ (it's something else)

---

![](images/knot-heart.jpg)

^ TODO the something else it is a desired outcome that we can achieve through a bunch of agile tools tied together else?

Learning about...[^1]

* Your users and what they're trying to achieve
* constrains you'd face running the service (technology/legislative)
* Underlying intent you've been asked to address
* Opportunities to improve

[^1]: https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works

^ I like this definition. I abbreviated it from GDS' service manual on agile delivery. They're looking at discovery through the lens of Service Design, but I think this definition applies pretty broadly.

---

> Before you commit to building a service, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved.

^ Also starts with this. [read it]

---

 > **Before** you **commit** to building a service, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved.

^ Focus on the before and the commit. Discovery is fundamentally an act of product assessment and risk management: . You're learning what you can early enough so you can help manage expectations. What is possible anywhere, what is possible for you in your context, what is impossible (to some value of impossible), what might fail, what might succeed, where value might lie, where TODO
^ You're taking a) figuring out the kind of outcome you might want
^ and b) taking all of the infinite possibilities that lie before you and using various techniques to whittle down to a more manageable selection that are more disposited to achieving that goal
^ TODO Make sure the quotes are standout. Different colour than other text?

---

# Dispositional

^ As an aside, we use the word "dispositional" a lot when we leave some of the more common agile tools behind (because we've accepted the fact that there are no certainties).
^ It simply means something that leans towards the outcome we want.

---

^ An example: if you want to have a hit blockbuster action movie, and you cast someone who is pretty unknown it's not going to have much draw. That said, if you find the right person and have other good attributes (Tom Holland-spiderman), you can still be disposed to making money.
^ Similarly, if you cast someone like Dwayne Johnson, it's got a pretty good chance of bringing people in on that alone. But there's always failures like Southland Tales ($350K on a $17m budget)

^ TODO a grid of films with these actors


---

^ TODO a whip. Maybe

^ I've seen teams committed to deliver services and products that were basically impossible based on the whims and fancies of people very far away from the product. While there's no avoiding that in some orgs, it helps to be armed with the best knowledge, ideas, and most importantly data that you can as EARLY AS possible. While some managers will never take their fingers out of their ears and continue to demand the impossible, many/most will listen to reason backed by data and ideas. Let me reiterate: data and ideas are the way out of a bunch of bad situations.

---

^ Importantly You are NOT trying to learn everything upfront. That's simply not possible. What you're trying to 

learn is enough to 

a) be talk/think/act coherently within the domain. -- Can't really do much on, say, a mapping project, if you don't understand a bit about tilesets, granularity, potentially geometric issues, possibly routing algorithms. Don't need absolute knowledge, but you do need enough to be coherent.

^ TODO ubiquitous language

b) to find clear, coherent goals that'll help you ensure you're going in the right direction -- As you can speak/think about the domain in the terms of the domain, you can 

^ TODO OKRs, roadmaps. What kind of roadmap? Decision inflected

c) to explore the space so you can find risks and pathways forward, 

^ TODO bias to action

d) to know what you're not doing.

^ TODO 

And here's the thing, you're going to do these things all at the same time, in a swirling dynamic of learning; ping-ponging back and forward between language, and goals, and exploration, and editing, until... we'll get to that.

^ TODO image getting built up: pre-a), empty space, a) items in the space, b) an area we want to reach in the space, c) squiggly arrow paths, d) red areas. P


---

But what to do?

^ TODO cat picture
^ That's a lot of big vague words, but you're a busy person and need to actually do something. Scrum has this big guide, with ceremonies, and roles, and a whole thing to follow. Can you have something like that, but for discovery?

---

No. 

---

No. (Maybe?)

^ Well, maybe something. Effective Agile is about arming yourself with tools and recipes, and trying them against problems. Then being honest about yourself with their shortfalls, imagining/learning new tools, and trying those. 


^ TODO image turning this into a cycle

---

^ Cynefin is a lens for this. It can help figure out appropriate approaches to take depending on what you know and what you don't know.


---

^ TODO lightly explain Cynefin, while apologising for next explaining it. Important to talk about the primary domains. Can largely ignore chaos.


---

^ TODO consider using Capability Red to simplify



---

^ TODO one possibility: take a dynamic approach.
^ Easy. Clear domain and starying there. Just Do It (nike logo). You already know what 

---

^ TODO other possibility just take about known/ordered vs unknown.
^ TODO decide whether to interweave or not. Leaning towards not.

^ Ordered (Known). If you know conceptually what most of the work is and you think you'd be able to do it without much learning, and you're mostly focussing on surfacing that knowledge.

---

^ TODO what unordered is

---

^ Ordered (known). 
^ TODO User story mapping. Explain why you'd use it, what it is, how you do it, briefly. Don't need to know everything. Helps surface.
^ What is this not: use MVP line. Iterate. Not enough: need something 

---

^ unordered
^ TODO much bigger bit. 

* Break out of regular sprints: you need to do stuff faster than you were before. If you were doing two week sprints, that's probably not what you should do now,
* Ceremonies: retrospectives (is process working? What can we improve? Turn up the good?), daily playback (what we learned in the last day - show more than tell. Use that to figure out what to do next)

---

^ Ordered (known)
^ TODO Roadmap. Delivery focussed. Options.



--- 

^ Unordered
^ TODO Roadmap. Strategy focussed. Decision points coming up: less clarity further out, caused by time, money, information. "By the time we reach here we need to know X. How do we do set ourselves up to have that data?"


---

^ TODO split problems between knowns and unknowns! You can do both.

---



---

---

^ TODO when to stop. 
* When to stop discovery? what constraints?
* What will it look like when I've finished discovery? 

---
^ TODO when to stop. 
  What artifacts will I be holding? 
* ARtifacts are important, conversations more important. ARtifacts useful only to the extent that they facillitate and prompt further conversation, as well as embody parts of that conversation. Enough to remember, but not constrain. 
* This is why things like JIRA can be problematic: if filling in or reading tickets is replacing conversations, you've got a problem. If you're demanding certain fields are mandatory in all circumstances, you need to be sure you understand the tradeoffs (away from conversations). If you're doing those things to capture conversations in as light a format as possible, great.

---
^ TODO when to stop. 
^ TODO Think through this in terms of your roadmap and needs. Do you know enough to achieve goals. Make progress to next decision point. Out of time.

---



---

^ TODO political (consider moving much earlier)
* Political: "Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past" Orwell (and then Rage.)
In a sense of sociotechnical dynamics, Discovery is about using the past and present to control the future. This scares people. Can push them to weigh in too heavily, shut options early.

Ways around this? Yes and. No stupid ideas.
Data-driven, not opinions.
Probes that check.

# Possible TODOs.


* Teams, discover, scale.
* Ideas, prompts, techniques for early phase conversations, team building,
* trying to align.
* What works. What doesn’t. 
* Communication patterns.
* Inception. Spikes. Experiments.
* Avoiding indecision. 
* Promoting scaling through separation.
* Good definition https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works
* Pre-mortems: how will  we fail? What causes that? Possibility trees. Work backwards, then forwards, repeat, loop. How do we mitigate? etc
* Pivot triggers: https://pivot-triggers.com/
* Pivot triggers: https://tomkerwin.substack.com/p/pivot-triggers-cheat-sheet-for-if?s=r
* Design sprints
* workshop: A3 individually to figure out purpose. Bring together
* more on the politics side
* Discover by doing. Practice, learn, reflect
* NOT trying to learn everything upfront. That's not possible. You're figuring out risks.
* Plant diagrams to track what you're doing
* focus on learning lots in short bursts. Select most promising. Dive deeper
* Data and metrics. Really learn: don't assume.
* Fowler: Lean Inception: https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/
* OKRs as framing
* How to write OKRs that don't suck: https://www.mindtheproduct.com/how-to-write-okrs-that-dont-suck-by-adrian-howard/
* ux. making sure they have input. Stopping more idealistic thinking that we can’t start until all research is done.
* A theme: can mean lots of meetings but that's not a bad thing. There are bad meetings but can be effective. Focus on learning.
* meetings are where the decisions happen: https://twitter.com/polotek/status/1500229729671999489
* meetings are real work: https://twitter.com/yvonnezlam/status/1500143379954290689
* cynefin inflected. Different states need different discovery. Dynamics to move between. Capability red?
* Don't try as regular sprint: it's different. What ceremonies will support rapid discovery?

* _What_ are you trying to discover? be clear! An approach that works? Information about a product? Enough roadmap to get started? What kind of roadmap?
  
* alongside knowing what you want, remember to apply agility. This is all negotiable. It changes. Think about applying INVEST in this context
* bias to action. Something you can show. Walking skeleton.
* Cynefin: discovery can be thought of as a dynamics that moves us from unknown to known, contextualising our work
* Stuff we know how to do (largely): user story mapping to lay it out, find the gaps
* Split the chunky parts of the problem between knowns and unknowns. Treat them differently. Go after unknowns first: they'll reshape your work.
* Game of life: initial conditions having overwhelming influence over outcomes. That's why this is political. Think about how to counteract.
* Political: "Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past" Orwell (and then Rage.)
* Frame around two teams (or more) with different issues. One known, one unknown, one political. Maybe compare afterwards what would have happened if you had picked the wrong solution for each?
* Is there something in the "What is discovery section?" that would be like explorers/conquerors finding a new land. Initially present is heroic, but then go into why it's usually not a good thing, because that wasn't new land and you're doing something not so good.
* OKRs to anchor direction
* What is this not?
* What will it look like when I've finished discovery? What artifacts will I be holding? 
* ARtifacts are important, conversations more important. ARtifacts useful only to the extent that they facillitate and prompt further conversation, as well as embody parts of that conversation. Enough to remember, but not constrain. 
* This is why things like JIRA can be problematic: if filling in or reading tickets is replacing conversations, you've got a problem. If you're demanding certain fields are mandatory in all circumstances, you need to be sure you understand the tradeoffs (away from conversations). If you're doing those things to capture conversations in as light a format as possible, great.
* When to stop discovery? what constraints?
* What does this look like practically? No one way. Agile is about arming yourself with tools and recipes, but knowing you'll need to improvise to meet your own needs. Cynefin as a lens for this.
* Break out of regular sprints: you need to do stuff faster than you were before. If you were doing two week sprints, that's probably not what you should do now,
* Ceremonies: retrospectives (is process working? What can we improve? Turn up the good?), daily playback (what we learned in the last day - show more than tell. Use that to figure out what to do next)

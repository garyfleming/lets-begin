# Possible TODOs.

* Break this up: Let’s Begin. Discovering Discovery. Teams, discover, scale. Ideas, prompts, techniques for early phase conversations, team building, and trying to align. What works. What doesn’t. Communication patterns. Inception. Spikes. Experiments. Avoiding indecision. Promoting scaling through separation.
* Pre-mortems: 
* Pivot triggers: https://pivot-triggers.com/
* Design sprints
* more on the politics side
* Discover by doing. Practice, learn, reflect
* Plant diagrams to track what you're doing
* focus on learning lots in short bursts. Select most promising. Dive deeper
* Data and metrics. Really learn: don't assume.
* Fowler: Lean Inception: https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/
* OKRs as framing

* cynefin inflected. Different states need different discovery. Dynamics to move between. Capability red?
* Don't try as regular sprint: it's different. What ceremonies will support rapid discovery?
* Frame: not being able to write. Blank page. Blank slate. Adaptation for this talk.
* _What_ are you trying to discover? be clear! An approach that works? Information about a product? Enough roadmap to get started? What kind of roadmap?
* alongside knowing what you want, remember to apply agility. This is all negotiable. It changes. Think about applying INVEST in this context

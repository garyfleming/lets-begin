# Possible TODOs.


* Teams, discover, scale.
* Ideas, prompts, techniques for early phase conversations, team building,
* trying to align.
* What works. What doesn’t. 
* Communication patterns.
* Inception. Spikes. Experiments.
* Avoiding indecision. 
* Promoting scaling through separation.
* Pre-mortems: how will  we fail? What causes that? Possibility trees. Work backwards, then forwards, repeat, loop. How do we mitigate? etc
* Pivot triggers: https://pivot-triggers.com/
* Pivot triggers: https://tomkerwin.substack.com/p/pivot-triggers-cheat-sheet-for-if?s=r
* Design sprints
* workshop: A3 individually to figure out purpose. Bring together
* more on the politics side
* Discover by doing. Practice, learn, reflect
* NOT trying to learn everything upfront. That's not possible. You're figuring out risks.
* Plant diagrams to track what you're doing
* focus on learning lots in short bursts. Select most promising. Dive deeper
* Data and metrics. Really learn: don't assume.
* Fowler: Lean Inception: https://martinfowler.com/articles/lean-inception/
* OKRs as framing
* How to write OKRs that don't suck: https://www.mindtheproduct.com/how-to-write-okrs-that-dont-suck-by-adrian-howard/
* ux. making sure they have input. Stopping more idealistic thinking that we can’t start until all research is done.
* A theme: can mean lots of meetings but that's not a bad thing. There are bad meetings but can be effective. Focus on learning.
* meetings are where the decisions happen: https://twitter.com/polotek/status/1500229729671999489
* meetings are real work: https://twitter.com/yvonnezlam/status/1500143379954290689
* cynefin inflected. Different states need different discovery. Dynamics to move between. Capability red?
* Don't try as regular sprint: it's different. What ceremonies will support rapid discovery?

* _What_ are you trying to discover? be clear! An approach that works? Information about a product? Enough roadmap to get started? What kind of roadmap?
  
* alongside knowing what you want, remember to apply agility. This is all negotiable. It changes. Think about applying INVEST in this context
* bias to action. Something you can show. Walking skeleton.
* Cynefin: discovery can be thought of as a dynamics that moves us from unknown to known, contextualising our work

* Split the chunky parts of the problem between knowns and unknowns. Treat them differently. Go after unknowns first: they'll reshape your work.
* Game of life: initial conditions having overwhelming influence over outcomes. That's why this is political. Think about how to counteract.
* "Retrospectives are planning. You cannot know what to do without know[ing] what you have done." https://twitter.com/ourfounder/status/1532101001947369473
* Frame around two teams (or more) with different issues. One known, one unknown, one political. Maybe compare afterwards what would have happened if you had picked the wrong solution for each?
* Is there something in the "What is discovery section?" that would be like explorers/conquerors finding a new land. Initially present is heroic, but then go into why it's usually not a good thing, because that wasn't new land and you're doing something not so good.
* OKRs to anchor direction
* What is this not?
---
* Need ways of knowing what problem you're not solving. Simple prompts? Strategy? Workshop?


## From feedback

* Need a better wrap up section: the abrupt stop does not work
* Better links at the end for stuff we don't explain, like Cynefin
* Literally put the words cynefin on screen and offer a better link forward
* Need a single developing example throughout: hill walking app
* Strategy roadmaps and normal roadmaps. Can be timed together using rough increments. Overlay them. Do both. CUSTOMERS WANT BOTH
* The three dispositional things should come together at the end. Bonus points for using literally the branching path picture
* "Inexperienced people: take it into account" --> how exactly?
* Stay purely factual on the film section
* more concrete examples on how to progress in discovery for safe to fail experiments
* More on artifacts. What should you be holding at the end?
* Organisations struggle because "the delivery work is valued more than the learning work" - Jeff Gothelf -- Definitely get something about Discovery as learning in
* Put something in at "all at once looping" about things like double diamond as a way of trying to make sense of that.



## Other ideas

* bit more on artifact
* Maybe something about who? Persona's matter. They're not equal in terms of focus. Part of "B) Goals"?
* Maybe produce a quick cheat sheet?
* Rejig Cynefin slides to be somewhat readable?
* Make stupid joke about graphic quality
* Expand USM section where the TODO is

* Too risky not to do learning
* Add chapter breaks now it's got segments?
* Roadmaps: Some tools that take a certainty and size based approach to roadmaps are pretty limited. No room to strategise, no other lenses, just "We think it's X big and we have capacity"
